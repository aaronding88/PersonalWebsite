            <p> Welcome to the Alpha version of Thruster! </p>
            <p> Thank you for helping me test my games in progress. It's extremely helpful to hear your input. </p>
            <p> Make sure to allow plugins! Unity loads the game through use of plug-ins, and you should be prompted to allow it. Do so. </p>
            <p> Currently, there is no instruction page in-game. However, that will be implemented in the near future. </p>

			<p> The controls for the games are simple: Click where you want to move to, 
            	and your character will thrust toward that position. The resulting exhaust
                will damage enemies, and knock bullets back. </p>
                
            <p> The goal is to survive as long as you can. The longer you survive, different
            	events start to occur. Future installments will contain even more events!
            </p>

            <p> </p>
            <p> Thank you, and enjoy!</p>
            <p> </p>
